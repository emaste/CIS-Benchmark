(4.1.3) Ensure changes to system administration scope (sudoers) is collected - Is this possible on FreeBSD?

4.2.2 Configure Journald - Systemd-journald looks to be Linux only so I skipped this section


## Cron/Perodic:

**5.1.4 - Secure at/cron/periodic to authorized users - Does periodic have allow/deny files? Couldn't locate them.**

## SSH
5.2.20 Ensure system-wide crypto policy is not over-ridden - N/A for FreeBSD

## User Accounts & Environment

(5.5.1.2) Ensure minimum days between password changes is 7 or more - No option for this in FreeBSD

5.5.1.2 - No option to switch warning for individual users

Ensure inactive password lock is 30 days or less - No option on FreeBSD

Ensure all users last password change date is in the past - No option on FreeBSD

## User and Group Settings 

(6.2.19) Ensure shadow group is empty - NA for FreeBSD

6.2.14 Ensure all groups in /etc/passwd exist in /etc/group - Script relies on Grep -P this is not an option of FreeBSd which breaks the script, can this be fixed?
